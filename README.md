# Student Score Prediction 📚📈

This project uses Linear and Polynomial Regression to predict a student's exam score based on their study hours.  
Developed as my first assignment at **Elevvo** to explore the fundamentals of supervised learning and model evaluation.

## Tools & Libraries
- Python 🐍
- scikit-learn 🤖
- matplotlib 📊
- Jupyter Notebook

## Key Metrics
- MSE & RMSE for error measurement
- R² Score: 0.98 with Polynomial Regression

## Output
The model helps visualize and understand the relationship between study time and expected performance.
